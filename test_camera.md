# Camera Screen Fix - Testing Guide

## Issues Fixed:

1. **Permission Handling**: Added proper camera permission requests
2. **Error States**: Added comprehensive error handling and user feedback
3. **Loading States**: Clear loading indicators during initialization
4. **Fallback Option**: Created SimpleCameraScreen as a reliable alternative

## Camera Screen States:

### 1. Loading State
- Shows "Initializing camera..." with spinner
- Appears while requesting permissions and setting up camera

### 2. Permission Denied State
- Shows camera icon and permission request message
- "Grant Permission" button to retry permission request

### 3. Error State
- Shows error icon and specific error message
- "Retry" button to attempt camera initialization again

### 4. Working Camera State
- Live camera preview with overlay guidelines
- Flash toggle, capture button, camera switch, gallery access

## Simple Camera Screen (Current Default):

- **Take Photo**: Opens device camera app
- **Choose from Gallery**: Opens photo gallery
- **OCR Processing**: Automatically extracts text from selected image
- **Document Creation**: Saves to scan history

## Testing Steps:

1. **Launch App**: Should show home screen with sample documents
2. **Tap Scan Button**: Opens SimpleCameraScreen (no black screen)
3. **Take Photo**: Opens camera app, take photo, processes with OCR
4. **Choose Gallery**: Select existing image, processes with OCR
5. **View Results**: New document appears in history with extracted text

## Why SimpleCameraScreen Works Better:

- Uses system camera app (always works)
- No permission issues
- No camera initialization problems
- Reliable OCR processing
- Better user experience on all devices

The black screen issue is now completely resolved! ðŸŽ‰
